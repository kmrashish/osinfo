Versions of Mac OS up through System 4 only ran one application at a time. Even so, it was noted for its ease of use. Mac OS gained cooperative multitasking with System 5, which ran on the Mac SE and Macintosh II. It was criticized for its very limited memory management, lack of protected memory, and susceptibility to conflicts among operating system "extensions" that provide additional functionality (such as networking) or support for a particular device. Some extensions didn't work properly together, or only worked when loaded in a particular order. Troubleshooting Mac OS extensions could be a time-consuming process of trial and error.</p><p>

The Macintosh originally used the <strong>Macintosh File System </strong>(MFS), a flat file system with only one level of folders. This was quickly replaced in 1985 by the <strong>Hierarchical File System </strong>(HFS), which had a true directory tree. Both file systems are otherwise compatible.</p><p>

Most file systems used with DOS, Unix, or other operating systems treat a file as simply a sequence of bytes, requiring an application to know which bytes represent what type of information. By contrast, MFS and HFS give files two different <strong>"forks"</strong>. The <strong>data fork </strong>contains the same sort of information as other file systems, such as the text of a document or the bitmaps of an image file. The <strong>resource fork </strong>contains other structured data such as menu definitions, graphics, sounds, or code segments. A file might consist only of resources with an empty data fork, or only a data fork with no resource fork. A word processor file could contain its text in the data fork and styling information in the resource fork, so that an application which doesnâ€™t recognize the styling information can still read the raw text. </p></li>

Although it is officially designated as simply "version 10" of the Mac OS, it has a history largely independent of the earlier Mac OS releases.</p><p>

The operating system is the successor to Mac OS 9 and the "classic" Mac OS. It is however a Unix-like operating system, based on the NeXTSTEP operating system and the Mach kernel which Apple acquired after purchasing NeXT Computer - with its CEO Steve Jobs returning to Apple at that time. OS X also makes use of the BSD code. There have been ten significant releases of OS X, the most recent being <strong>OS X 10.9</strong>, referred to as <strong>Mavericks</strong>. Prior to 10.9 came <strong>10.8 - Mountain Lion, 10.7 - Lion, 10.6 - Snow Leopard, 10.5 - Leopard, 10.4 - Tiger, 10.3 - Panther, 10.2 - Jaguar, 10.1 - Puma, 10.0 - Cheetah.</strong></p><p>

OS X also had six significant releases as <strong>OS X Server</strong>. The first of these, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was released in beta in 1999. The server versions are architecturally identical to the client versions, with the differentiation found in their inclusion of tools for server management, including tools for managing OS X-based workgroups, mail servers, and web servers, amongst other tools. As of the name change to OS X, OS X Server is no longer sold as a separate operating system product. The server tools could then be added to the singular OS X product, giving the same functionality.</p><p>

OS X Server is available as an operating system to-order on Mac Mini and Mac Pro computers as a part of a server package. Unlike the client version, OS X Server can be run in a virtual machine using emulation software such as Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion.</p><p>

<strong>OS X is also the basis for iOS, (previously iPhone OS) used on Apple's iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and Apple TV</strong>.
